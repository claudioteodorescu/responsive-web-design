              <h3>Feb 24, 1955: Steve Jobs is Born</h3>
              <p>
                Gradute student Joanne Schieble gives birth in San Francisco to
                a boy who is adopted by Paul and Clara Jobs of Mountain View,
                Calif., and named Steven Paul Jobs.

              <p>
                College dropouts Steve Jobs, 21, and Steve Wozniak, 26, build
                the first Apple computer in a garage in Los Altos, Calif. The
                pair raise $1,300 by selling a van and two calculators and
                launch Apple as a company on April Fools’ Day.

              <h3>1977: Apple II Computers are Sold</h3>
              <p>
                The first Apple II computers go on sale for $1,295 and become an
                instant hit. The Apple II is the first computer to display color
                images and the first to come with a keyboard, and in 1979 it
                becomes the first to offer a “killer app” – Visicalc – a
                spreadsheet program.

              <h3>1984: The Macitonish is Released</h3>
              <p>
                The Macintosh, which Jobs envisions as “the people’s computer,”
                is introduced. It incorporates key elements of the Lisa such as
                a mouse and features a revolutionary graphical interface. Apple
                airs its legendary “1984” advertisement during the Super Bowl,
                and sells 70,000 Macs in the first 100 days. Watch Apple’s Super
                Bowl broadcast. Apple’s Lisa computer, named after Jobs’ oldest
                daughter, bombed, perhaps because of its $10,000 price, leading
                Jobs to bring in John Sculley as president of the company.

              <h3>1985: Jobs is Fired from Apple</h3>
              <p>
                With Mac sales stagnating and the company wracked by infighting,
                Sculley ousts Jobs in a dramatic boardroom coup. In the
                following year he founds Next Computer and buys George Lucas’
                computer graphics division, which eventually becomes Pixar
                Animation Studios.

              <h3>1991: Apple Suffers</h3>
              <p>
                Apple’s profit and market share slide. The company lays off 10%
                of its work force, introduces lowcost Macs and negotiates an
                alliance with rival IBM Corp. Two years later, Apple’s board
                ousts company president John Sculley for not paying enough
                attention to daytoday operations. A wave of executive departures
                and poor forecasting of demand leave Apple in disarray even as
                the PC market booms.

              <p>
                Apple buys Jobs’ Next Computer Inc. and hires him as an
                consultant. He is named iterim cheif executive the next year and
                just being a consultant. With the help of Jobs, the company
                start to become profitable again, with the introduction of its
                translucent, brightly colored iMac and iBook computers.

                With Jobs as the permanent CEO, Apple transforms the way people
                consume music with the introduction of the iPod. More than 300
                million iPods have been sold since. Two years later iTunes is
                released and sells a million songs within a week.

                Jobs undergoes surgery for pancreatic cancer. The next year, in
                a speech at Stanford University, Jobs addresses his bout with
                cancer. “No one wants to die. Even people who want to go to
                heaven don’t want to die to get there. And yet death is the
                destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it.”

                In January, Jobs announces he will be taking another medical
                leave, for unspecified reasons. In August, Jobs steps down as
                Apple's chief executive. In October, Jobs dies after a long
